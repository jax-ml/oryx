"""A basic pattern matching system.

The following is a self-contained pattern matching system based on a pattern
matcher written for
[MIT class 6.945](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6.945/) in 2009.
The API closesly mirrors the Scheme API found in
[`rules`](https://github.com/axch/rules) by Alexey Radul. The star matching
implementation  is based on the one found in
[Autoconj](https://github.com/google-research/autoconj)
by Matthew D. Hoffman, Matthew J. Johnson, and Dustin Tran. Specifically, the
signature for `matcher` resembles the corresponding signature in `rules` and
`autoconj`, but instead of returning a sequences matches from `matcher`
directly, this library uses generators to return an iterator over matches.

This library is related to the
[`matchpy`](https://github.com/HPAC/matchpy) library, but additionally supports
the `Choice` and `Star` patterns which aren't yet supported in `matchpy`, along
with a different approach to extensibility (single-dispatch functions). However,
`matchpy` additionally supports faster many-to-one matchers and native support
for associative and commutative operators.

# Usage

By default, expressions are matched by Python equality. To build more
sophisticated patterns that can match expressions that are not just equal
to each other, we provide match combinators, or "higher-order patterns", like
`Not`, `Star` and `Choice`.

## `match`

The `match` method takes in a pattern and an expression to match.
If the expression does not match the pattern, a `MatchError` is thrown.
`match` returns a dictionary of "bindings", where a binding is a mapping of a
name to a value. The bindings can be substituted into the pattern in order to
make the pattern and expression equal. The `Var` pattern described below
demonstrates how to create bindings in a match.


```python
match(1, 1)  # ==> {}
match('abc', 'abc')  # ==> {}
match((1, 2), (1, 2))  # ==> {}
match({'a': 1, 'b': 2}, {'a': 1, 'b': 2})  # ==> {}
match(1, 2) # ==> MatchError!
```

A `Sequence` pattern matches a `Sequence` expression if each of its elements
matches.
Similarly, a `dict` pattern matches a `dict` expression if their keys are
the same and the corresponding values match.

Also provided are `is_match(pattern, expr)`, which returns `True` if the
expression matches the pattern and `False` if not, and
`match_all(pattern, expr)`, which returns an iterator over all possible
bindings that successfully make the pattern and expression equal.

## `Var`

We can use `Var`s to define wildcard values that can match any expression.
If a pattern containing `Var`s matches an expression, `match` will return a
dictionary of bindings that maps the name of the `Var`s to the expressions that
makes the pattern and expression equal. If the same `Var` appears multiple times
in a pattern, the value needs to be the same across each of the instances for a
successful match.

```python
match(Var('x'), 1)  # ==> {'x': 1}
match((Var('x'), Var('x')), (1, 1))  # ==> {'x': 1}
match((Var('x'), Var('x')), (1, 2))  # ==> MatchError!
match({'a': 1, 'b': Var('x'}), {'a': 1, 'b': 2})  # ==> {'x': 2}
```

We can apply restrictions to `Var`s to condition the types of values they can
match.

```python
is_even = lambda x: x % 2 == 0
x = Var('x', restrictions=[is_even])
match(x, 2) # ==> {'x': 2}
match(x, 3) # ==> MatchError!
```

`Dot` is a `Var` that will match any expression without binding a name
to a value. It is equivalent to `Var(None)`.

```python
match(Dot, 2) # ==> {}
match(Dot, (1, 2, 3)) # ==> {}
```

## `Not`

`Not` takes a pattern and successfully matches an expression if the provided
pattern does not match it.

```python
match(Not(1), 2) # ==> {}
match(Not(2), 2) # ==> MatchError!
match(Not(Var('x')), 2) # ==> MatchError!
```

## `Choice`

`Choice` takes in a sequence of patterns and tries matching each of them to an
expression, and on first success, returns the successful match. `Choice`
also takes in an optional name that is used when binding the successful match.

```python
match(Choice(1, 2), 1) # ==> {}
match(Choice(1, 2), 2) # ==> {}
match(Choice(Var('x'), 2), 2) # ==> {'x': 2}
match(Choice((1, 2), (2, 1), name='x'), (2, 1)) # ==> {'x': (2, 1)}
```

## `Star`, `Plus`, and `Segment`

The `Star`, `Plus` and `Segment` patterns are used when matching sequences.
Specifically, they can match variable-length slices of a sequence. `Star` takes
in a pattern and matches a sequence slice if all of its elements match the
pattern.
`Star` must be used inside of a sequence.

```python
match((Star(1),), ()) # ==> {}
match((Star(1),), (1,)) # ==> {}
match((Star(1),), (1, 1)) # ==> {}
match((Star(1),), (1, 2)) # ==> MatchError!
match((3, Star(1), 2), (3, 1, 1, 1, 2)) # ==> {}
```

`Plus` is exactly like `Star`, but will not match zero-length slices.

```python
match((Plus(1),), (1,)) # ==> {}
match((Plus(1),), ()) # ==> MatchError!
```

`Star` and `Plus` optionally take in a `name` that will be used to bind the
matched slice. Like `Var`, if the same name appears in multiple places, the same
bound value must be able to be substituted into the pattern in each element
of the slice to make the expression match.

```python
match((Star(1, name='x'),), (1, 1, 1)) # ==> {'x': (1, 1, 1)}
match((Star(1, name='x'), 2), (1, 1, 2)) # ==> {'x': (1, 1)}
match((Star(Dot, name='x'), 4), (1, 2, 3, 4))  # ==> {'x': (1, 2, 3)}
```

If the pattern inside of a `Star` has any names in it (from `Var`s or
nested `Star`s), the same value needs to match for the entire slice. If name
`'x'` needs to be bound to `1` to make an element of a slice match, it needs to
be `1` for every subsequent element of the sequence. For example, in the
following
snippets, `x` cannot be bound to multiple values to make the match succeed.

```python
match((Star(Var('x')),), (1, 1)) # ==> {'x': 1}
match((Star(Var('x')),), (1, 2)) # ==> MatchError!
```


Alternatively, we can "accumulate" the bindings for a name inside of a `Star`
by providing the name to the `accumulate` argument to `Star`. `Star` tries to
match each element of a slice to its pattern. For `Var`s inside of a `Star`,
this means that the value bound to its name must match across the slice.
When we accumulate for a name inside of a `Star`, rather than enforcing that the
match is the same across the slice, we collect the individual matches into a
sequence and bind the name to the sequence.
```python
match((Star(Var('x'), accumulate=['x']),), (1, 2, 3)) # ==> {'x': (1, 2, 3)}
match((Star((Var('x'), Var('y')), accumulate=['y']),), ((1, 2), (1, 3)))
# ==> {'x': 1, 'y': (2, 3)}
```

Another example of using an accumulating `Star` is to match expressions that
exhibit the distributive property, i.e. `a * b + a * c`.

```
Mul = lambda *args: ('*', *args)
Add = lambda *args: ('+', *args)
distributive = Add(Star(Mul(Var('x'), Var('y')), accumulate=['y']))
match(distributive, Add(Mul('a', 'b'), Mul('a', 'c')))
# ==> {'x': 'a', 'y': ('b', 'c')}
match(distributive, Add(Mul('a', 'b'), Mul('c', 'd'))) # MatchError!
```

A `Segment` is shorthand for a named `Star` that has the `Dot` pattern,
meaning it matches slices of a sequence regardless of the individual values.
Specifically, `Segment(name)` matches the same expressions as
`Star(Dot, name=name)`.
```python
match((Segment('a'),), (1, 1, 1)) # ==> {'a': (1, 1, 1)}
```

# Extending the system

The pattern matching library is based on a single-dispatch function, `matcher`.
`matcher` takes in a "pattern", which can be any Python object. It returns a
function `match(expr, bindings, succeed)`, where `expr` is an expression to
match, `bindings` is a dictionary mapping names to values, and `succeed`
is a function that takes in `bindings` (that could be extended by the match)
and returns an iterator over results.

To extend the system to include new patterns, there are two options:

1.  We can register a custom type with `matcher`. `matcher` is a
single-dispatch function, so we can override its behavior for custom types.
By default, `matcher` returns a `match` that only succeeds if the pattern and
expression are equal according to Python equality. To extend it for a custom
type `Foo` that we'd like to match against, we can call
`matcher.register(Foo)(custom_matcher)` to define a custom matcher for `Foo`
objects. This is how we define matchers for sequences and dictionaries.

2. Alternatively, we provide the `Pattern` class which is the parent class
of the various combinators (`Choice`, `Not`, `Star`, etc.). By subclassing
`Pattern` and implementing the  `match(self, expr, bindings, succeed)` method,
the class is automatically registered with `matcher`.

  a length-1 string. This, by default, triggers an infinite recursion in the
  sequence matcher. To avoid this, we special-case 1-length strings to do a
  manual match and use the sequence matcher for other strings.

  Args:
    pattern: A pattern used to match a string.
  Returns:
    A pattern matcher for string expressions.
