"""Contains the `Einsum` expression and utilities.

The `Einsum` pattern is used for pattern matching and term rewriting in JAX.
JAX does not have an underlying einsum primitive; a call to `jnp.einsum` turns
into its component `dot_general`, `broadcast`, and `transpose` primitives and
therefore einsums do not directly appear in JAXprs. Autoconj is based on
rewriting expressions and combining expressions into large einsums and because
JAX does not have a primitive representation, we need to create our own.

Along with the `Einsum` pattern we include utilities for manipulating
einsums. For example, the `compose_einsums` function contains the logic for
taking two nested einsums and combining them into a single one. These utilities
are needed for systems such as
[Autoconj](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2018/hash/9b89bedda1fc8a2d88c448e361194f02-Abstract.html),
which aim to create large, monolothic einsums in a program. The functions are
based on their [implementations in
Autoconj](https://github.com/google-research/autoconj/blob/master/autoconj/rewrites.py).

  Einsums are linear functions and thus the composition of two (or more) einsums
  can be represented as a single one. Composed einsums often come up during the
  term rewriting phase of Autoconj, where a series of linear operations (a
  matrix multiplication followed by a transpose, for example) need to be
  folded together into a single einsum in order to represent a function as a
  sum of einsums. This function takes a composition of einsums (an einsum with
  an einsum as one its arguments) and returns a flattened, single einsum.

  As an example use-case, suppose we have matrices `w, x, y` and `z` along with
  the following `Einsum`s:
  ```python
  child_op = Einsum('ab,bc->ac', (x, y))
  parent_op = Einsum('ab,bc,cd->ad', (w, child_op, z))
  ```

  These two operations can be combined to form the single `Einsum`
  ```python
  combined_op = Einsum('ab,bc,cd,de->ae', (w, x, y, z))
  ```
