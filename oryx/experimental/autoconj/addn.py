"""Contains the `AddN` expression.

The `AddN` expression represents a sum of operands. JAX only has a binary
`add` primitive, meaning a sequence of adds is represented as an expression
tree of `add` primitives. In `autoconj`, we'd like to roll all the `add`s into
a single expression to simplify rewrite rules and to represent a canonicalized
density function. Thus we use `AddN` to represent a flat sum of operands.
