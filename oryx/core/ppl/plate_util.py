"""Contains utilities for the `plate` transformation.

A plate is a term in graphical models that is used to designate independent
random variables. In Oryx, `plate` is a transformation that converts a program
into one that produces independent samples. Ordinarily, this can be done with
`jax.vmap`, where we could split several random keys and map a program over
them. Unlike `jax.vmap`, `plate` operates using named axes. A `plate`-ed
program will specialize the random seed to the particular index of the axis
being mapped over. Taking the `log_prob` of a `plate` program will reduce over
the named axis. In design, `plate` resembles the `Sharded` meta-distribution
from TensorFlow Probability.

In implementation, `plate` is an Oryx `HigherOrderPrimitive` (i.e. a JAX
`CallPrimitive` with a `log_prob` rule that reduces over a named axis at the
end.
